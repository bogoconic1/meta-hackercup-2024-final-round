Problem Statement:
{statement}

Possible Time Complexity:
{time_complexity}

Possible Concepts:
{concepts}

Code:
{code}

Your Task:
1. You are given a problem statement, together with a code that someone has written to solve the problem, above. Please pay attention to the constraints.
2. Next, you are given a piece of code. 
3. Determine the time complexity of the code.
4. With the time complexity in (3), is the code fast enough to execute given the problem constraints?
5. If your answer to (4) is NO, think of an alternative approach to solve the problem, such that it is fast enough to execute given the problem constraints. 
6. Ask yourself, does your new approach has equal or lower time complexity than the existing solution ?
7. If your answer to (4) is YES or (6) is NO, code the exact same program that was given. Else, implement the code for the new approach in the `solve` method below.

```python
<insert necessary imports>
def solve(input: str) -> str: 
```
